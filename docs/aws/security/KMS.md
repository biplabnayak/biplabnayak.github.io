### Symmetric cryptography
* Single key is used for both encryption and decryption.
* Disadvantage : if the key is compromised, encrypted data could be easily decrypted
* Commonly used Algorithms :
   * AED
   * DES
   * Triple DES
   * Blowfish
* Symmetric is faster
### ASymmetric Cryptography
* 2 Separate keys for encryption and decryption. created at the same time and linked with mathematical algorithm
* private key should never be shared
* public key can be shared with anyone.
* Both keys are required to decrypted data
* Asymmetric is slower
* commonly used Algorithm :
   * RSA - (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
   * Diffie-Hellman
   * Digital signature algorithm
    
## KMS
* KMS contain key to decrypt private data
