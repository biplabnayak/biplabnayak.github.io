# Disaster Recovery

Common Metrics for business continuity
* Recovery Time Objective - RTO the time it takes after a disruption to restore a business process to its service level as was defined by the operational level agreement.
* Recovery Point Objective - RPO is the acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. So just to confuse everyone, it is also a time value, but it's a slightly different one. The two are quite different concepts. So the acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. So for example, if that disaster occurred at 12 o'clock around lunchtime and the RPO is one hour, the system should recover all data that was in the system before 11:00 a.m. So the data loss will spend only one hour between 11:00 a.m and 12:00 p.m.
